**Universal Inject Generator**


This script will generate inject-ready apps from homebrew CIAs to inject over the Health & Safety app in the 3DS console. The package includes code by @Syphurith, CTRtool (by profi200) and 3DStool (by dnasdw). 

This is used in conjunction with most recent (mine) Decrypt9's "Dump Health&Safety" and "Inject Health&Safety" features. You can only inject .apps smaller or equal in size to the original H&S app. Decrypt9 has a safety check build in and won't proceed with bigger ones. Per CIA, two inject apps will be created - with and without banner - the one with a banner is preferable, but may be to large to inject.

This is how it works:
* Put hs.app (dumped via Decrypt9) plus as many homebrew CIAs as you like into the input folder.
* Run go.bat, you'll get one inject-ready .app per CIA.
* If the last one for some reason doesn't work, you may try deep-decrypting (via Decrypt9) your CIAs first.
* To inject, rename inject-ready .app to hs.app, put it into the root of your 3DS SD card and inject via Decrypt9.

Linux users: you need `libstdc++6` and `gcc` installed. Ubuntu users also need to update to the toolchain version as described here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/16605759/4666756

You should always generate your inject-ready .apps yourself and never take ones from other persons. There might be a version mismatch in the H&S app, leading to it not working otherwise.
